# Instance Methods
# Instance methods can access all attributes of the instance and have self as a parameter.

# Class Methods
# Methods which need access to class attributes but not instance attributes are marked as Class Methods.
# For class methods, we send cls as a parameter indicating we are passing the class.


# Static Method
# We might need some generic methods that donâ€™t need access to either instance or class attributes. These type of methods are called Static Methods.
# Usually, static methods are used to create utility functions which make more sense to be part of the class.
